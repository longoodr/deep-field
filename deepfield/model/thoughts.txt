Optimize prediction model, transition function in parallel: use backpropagation for prediction model (which can be a simple neural network) and use genetic algorithm for transition function (which is a map from outcomes to unit vectors)

Question of when to resample transition functions?
    - One extreme: resample after every maximal antichain
    - Other extreme: resample after each pass over maximal antichain lattice
        - Could even do several passes instead
    - In either case, resample occurs after a certain number of maximal antichains. This parameter is akin to a learning rate and can be scheduled

To train:
    (Parametrized by:
        Population size,
        Prediction model structure,
        Number of maximal antichains before resample
    )
    Generate initial population
    While not converged:
        For each (prediction model, transition function, player ratings) tuple:
            Reset player ratings
        For each maximal antichain in maximal antichain lattice:
            For each (prediction model, transition function, player ratings) tuple:
                Backprop prediction model against actual outcome distributions in maximal antichain
                For each play in maximal antichain:
                    Use prediction model to compute KL divergence between actual and expected outcomes for each play
                    Add KL divergence to transition function loss (lower loss => more fit)
                    Compute transition function unit vector from play outcome
                    Scale vector by KL divergence
                    Update player ratings by scaled vector
            If time to resample:
                Resample population

To resample population:
    (Parametrized by:
        Culling population fraction,
        Mutation population fraction
    )
    Cull least fit members
    While population isn't full:
        Choose two mates, proportional to fitness
        Generate two children's transition functions
        Each child randomly get's copy of one parent's prediction model, player ratings
        Add children to population
    Mutate population's transition functions
